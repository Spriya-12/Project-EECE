## Layout Grid  
The image represents an integrated circuit (IC) layout with a structured grid system. Below is a rough breakdown of the grid elements:  

| Block | Coordinates | Description |
|--------|------------|------------|
| X0Y3  | Top-left   | Circuit block |
| X1Y3  | Top-center | Circuit block |
| X0Y2  | Middle-left | Circuit block |
| X1Y2  | Middle-center | Circuit block |
| X0Y1  | Bottom-left | Circuit block |
| X1Y1  | Bottom-center | Circuit block |
| X0Y0  | Bottom-left | Circuit block |
| X1Y0  | Bottom-right | Circuit block |

### Notes:
- The grid layout follows **X-Y coordinate naming**.
- Different **colors** represent **routing layers and interconnects**.
- Additional **metal traces and vias** are visible.
