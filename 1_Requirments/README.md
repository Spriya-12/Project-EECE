# Requirements for Dual Port RAM Implementation

## High-Level Requirements (HLR)
1. **Efficient Memory Design:**
   - Develop a specialized memory module supporting simultaneous read and write operations on independent ports.
2. **System Compatibility:**
   - Ensure compatibility with FPGA hardware for scalable and high-performance memory applications.
3. **Verification and Testing:**
   - Perform comprehensive functional and performance validation using SystemVerilog testbenches.
4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Optimize resource utilization, focusing on scalability, power efficiency, and throughput improvements.

## Low-Level Requirements (LLR)
1. **Independent Port Access:**
   - Implement separate read and write logic for independent port functionality.
2. **Arbitration and Collision Handling:**
   - Integrate mechanisms to resolve conflicts when both ports access the same memory location.
3. **Toolchain Utilization:**
   - Utilize Xilinx Vivado for synthesis, simulation, and testing.
4. **Testbench Development:**
   - Develop functional test cases to simulate edge scenarios and concurrent operations.
5. **SystemVerilog Transition:**
   - Transition the design to SystemVerilog for advanced verification using UVM (Universal Verification Methodology).
6. **Scalability Enhancements:**
   - Support advanced memory design features, including larger memory blocks and additional verification.
